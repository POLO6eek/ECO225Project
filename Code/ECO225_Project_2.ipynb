    "With the development of modern cities and urbanization, the global average temperature has been increasing over the past century, leading to concerns about the impacts of climate change. While urbanization significantly improves life standards and society efficiency, it is commonly believed to be a significant contributor to the global warming process. \n",
    "\n",
    "China, one of the fastest-growing developing countries in the world, is undergoing rapid urbanization in the recent few decades. This research aims to examine the role of urbanization in shaping average temperature trends in China. The analysis will be focused on finding the relationship between average temperature and other independent variables such as city, years, and percentage change in annual temperature based on a time series analysis starting from 1950 to 2012. Specifically, 1979 to 2012 is the period China decided to begin the journey of reforming and opening up. We will use year as independent variable to show the trend of annual temperature change between 1950 to 2012. We will also study the difference in annual average temperature using city as independent variable. We will use percentage in annual average temperature as the independent variable to see the frequency of cities that has a temperature over certain value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Several studies have investigated the role of urbanization in shaping average temperature trends in China. Li et al. (2013) highlighted the importance of land cover change and human activity in contributing to observed warming. Similarly, the contribution of urbanization to warming in China was found to be significant, accounting for approximately one-third of the total warming signal (Sun et al., 2016). Moreover, the magnitude of urbanization-induced warming effects was found to depend not only on a city's economic level, but also on its population scale and geographic environment (Fang et al., 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "By investigating the impact of urbanization on temperature trends in China, this study will further enhance our understanding of the interaction between human activity and the environment. We find out that the average temperature is increasing overall between 1978 to 2012, and remained stable between 1950 to 1978. This shows that the relationship between urbanization and economic development is positively related to the warming of China. The overall average temperature is increasing in China, with more extreme high-temperature years and less low-temperature years. "

Our analysis indicates that the majority of cities experienced a positive temperature change, with most cities having a percentage change of around 18.5.

However, from 1979 to 2012, during a period of rapid economic development and urbanization, most cities had an annual percentage change in temperature ranging from 18.25 to 19.00. This indicates that temperatures have increased in China over the past few decades, with evidence pointing to urbanization as a significant factor in this trend.\n",

    "In conclusion, the research found that urbanization plays an important role in shaping average temperature trends in China from 1950 to 2012. As the graphs and evidence suggest, we see that the temperature is increasing at a higher speed from 1979 to 2012 (when urbanization happened and the economy starts to bloom in China) compared with 1950 to 1978 (when the economy is growing very slowly). In addition, the average annual temperature is increasing in China from 1950 to 2012. More and more cities experienced extremely high-temperature years and fewer cities experienced low-temperature years.\n",
    "\n",
    "As urban areas start to grow, cities will experience higher temperatures due to potential factors such as industrialization and pollution, which can be discussed in future research. We can combine it with the population dataset for future implementation and study the relationship between population and temperature change. These findings are important to our understanding of global warming and may give us some suggestions for how to maintain the balance between society's development and the stability of the enviroment.
